# docker-audiostreamer
Listen to your music from home with just a HTML5 enabled webbrowser. Brings your music to you everywhere in the world. 

Based on the great PHP written audiostreamer from https://audiostreamer.org, combined with a tiny fix and updated software libs, 
packed for instant use, thanks to Docker.
